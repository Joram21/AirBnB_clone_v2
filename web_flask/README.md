A web framework is a pre-built collection of libraries and tools that provide a structure for building web applications. It simplifies the development process by offering reusable code and design patterns, which allows developers to focus on writing application-specific code rather than handling low-level details like HTTP request handling, routing, and database interactions. Web frameworks help standardize development practices and make it easier to build, maintain, and scale web applications.
